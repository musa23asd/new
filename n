Causes and Effects of Climate Change

Main Causes:

1. Deforestation – Trees are cut down to make paper, wooden furniture, farmland, and residential areas. This reduces the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change.


2. Burning Fossil Fuels – Electricity and heat generation from coal, oil, and natural gas release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.


3. Industrial Emissions – Factories burn fossil fuels to produce cement, iron, steel, plastics, electronics, and clothing, leading to high carbon emissions.


4. Transportation – Cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes mostly run on fossil fuels, making the transport sector a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.


5. Food Production – Farming releases carbon dioxide, methane, and other harmful gases. Additionally, forests are cleared to create farmland, worsening climate change.



Effects of Climate Change:

1. Rising Temperatures – The Earth's temperature has been increasing at a rate of 0.15 to 0.2°C per decade since 1982. The last decade (2014–2024) has recorded the highest temperatures, leading to more wildfires, which have increased by up to 50% in some regions.


2. Rising Sea Levels – Oceans absorb most of the extra heat, causing water expansion (about 0.13 inches per year). Melting glaciers and polar ice add to sea-level rise, leading to frequent coastal flooding. For example, Venice is sinking by 1mm per year and could be 4 feet underwater by the end of the century.


3. Extreme Weather – Storms are becoming stronger and more frequent. Droughts are increasing due to changes in water availability, affecting agriculture and daily life.


4. Loss of Biodiversity – Species are disappearing at a rate 1,000 times faster than ever recorded in history due to habitat destruction and climate changes.


5. Food Shortages – Climate change affects crop growth, leading to food scarcity in many parts of the world.


6. Health Issues – Air pollution, extreme weather, and food shortages are increasing diseases, mental health issues, and malnutrition, especially in vulnerable communities.



Climate change is already affecting our planet in serious ways. Reducing fossil fuel use, protecting forests, and adopting sustainable practices are essential to slow down its impact.
