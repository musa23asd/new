The thing is for " to add a new vehicle." i want similar to above as we did for add driver, just similar format 
after that i want something in add new vehicle
This is flow is fine but the problem is that there are many scenarios like driver details modification etc etc, how should we create a flow so that a perfect story line can be made and also repetions can be avoided I am running out of Ideas and cannot do anything due to it
