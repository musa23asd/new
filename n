4.1.	Why ESG Matters Now: The Changing Landscape (Source: 2024 global insurance outlook) (ESG impact on the insurance industry: PwC)

4.1.1	Heightened Stakeholder Expectations:
Beyond regulators and investors, employees, customers, and business partners now demand that insurers address ESG issues head on. These shifting expectations mean that robust ESG practices are increasingly seen as essential for long-term business resilience.

4.1.2	Regulatory Pressure:
Recent regulatory moves—such as the SEC’s proposed climate disclosure requirements and updated NAIC climate risk surveys—are forcing insurers to move from voluntary disclosures to mandatory, TCFD-aligned reporting. This shift not only increases transparency but also heightens legal accountability for how insurers manage climate risks.

4.1.3	Expanding Portfolios - Go Green : AI, ESG, and cyber lead insurance trends – GlobalData | Insurance Business America

4.2.	Product Innovation: 
Facing escalating risks and tighter reinsurance, insurers are rethinking their product offerings. Traditional indemnity insurance—often slow due to lengthy loss assessments—is giving way to innovative models such as parametric insurance. With parametric policies, payouts are triggered automatically by measurable parameters (like wind speed or rainfall levels).

4.3.	Modernizing Underwriting for a New Climate- AI-ML/Advanced Analytics/Big Data Adoption
Companies that relied solely on historical loss data are now scrambling as their underwriting models underestimate future risks. Insurers are increasingly adopting advanced tools—such as satellite imagery, real-time weather feeds, and machine learning—to run “climate stress tests.” How Innovative Insurance Products Can Bridge the Climate Insurance Gap | Asian Development Blog
4.4.	Digital Transformation and Process Automation
Remote risk assessments, blockchain-based claims processing, and real‑time customer interfaces are making operations more efficient. These digital improvements are reducing turnaround times and enabling insurers to respond faster to evolving risks, compared to slower manual processes in previous years.https://www.sas.com/en_sa/news/press-releases/2024/december/insurance-predictions-2025.html
4.5.	Claims and Operational Advancements 
The surge in claims can overwhelm even the most robust systems. Extreme weather events have led to a dramatic increase in both the frequency and complexity of claims. In many cases, traditional claims processing systems—designed for predictable, historical loss patterns—are unable to cope with the volume and severity of damage now experienced. 
To address these challenges, insurers are turning to digital transformation. Artificial intelligence and remote sensing technologies are now integral to speeding up damage assessments and automating parts of the claims process. 
5.	Conclusion: Embracing a Climate-Driven Future 
From the initial shock of a disaster due to climate change to the sweeping adjustments in underwriting, premium setting, claims processing, product innovation, market distribution, climate change is challenging the insurance industry.
