2.Cause and Effect of Climate change  

2.1Main reasons: 

Deforestation – Trees are cut down to make paper, wooden furniture, farmland, and residential areas. This reduces the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change. 

Burning Fossil Fuels – Electricity and heat generation from coal, oil, and natural gas release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 

Industrial Emissions – Factories burn fossil fuels to produce cement, iron, steel, plastics, electronics, and clothing, leading to high carbon emissions. 

Transportation – Cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes mostly run on fossil fuels, making the transport sector a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. 

Food Production – Farming releases carbon dioxide, methane, and other harmful gases. Additionally, forests are cleared to create farmland, worsening climate change. 

2.2Effect of climate change 

Rising Temperatures – The Earth's temperature has been increasing at a rate of 0.15 to 0.2°C per decade since 1982. The last decade (2014–2024) has recorded the highest temperatures, leading to more wildfires, which have increased by up to 50% in some regions. 

Rising Sea Levels – Oceans absorb most of the extra heat, causing water expansion (about 0.13 inches per year). Melting glaciers and polar ice add to sea-level rise, leading to frequent coastal flooding. For example, Venice is sinking by 1mm per year and could be 4 feet underwater by the end of the century. 

Extreme Weather – Storms are becoming stronger and more frequent. Droughts are increasing due to changes in water availability, affecting agriculture and daily life. 

Loss of Biodiversity – Species are disappearing at a rate 1,000 times faster than ever recorded in history due to habitat destruction and climate changes. 

Food Shortages – Climate change affects crop growth, leading to food scarcity in many parts of the world. 

Health Issues – Air pollution, extreme weather, and food shortages are increasing diseases, mental health issues, and malnutrition, especially in vulnerable communities.
