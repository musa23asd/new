2. Cause and Effect of Climate Change

Climate change is driven by a variety of human activities, and its effects are being felt across the globe. While some of the following data use global or US examples as benchmarks, these trends are broadly applicable worldwide.

2.1 Main Reasons

Deforestation
Trees are cut down for paper, furniture, farmland, and residential areas, reducing the Earth’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.
Comparison: In the 1990s, global deforestation was estimated at around 16 million hectares per year, which declined to about 10 million hectares per year during 2015–2020—but recent wildfire events have accelerated tree cover loss, with some regions reporting losses up to 28 million hectares in 2023.

Burning Fossil Fuels
The generation of electricity and heat from coal, oil, and natural gas releases large amounts of greenhouse gases.
Comparison: Global fossil fuel emissions increased by roughly 51% from 1990 to 2021, and after a temporary dip during the early 2020s, emissions rebounded by 0.8% in 2024 due to increased activity in sectors like aviation and coal power.

Industrial Emissions
Factories burning fossil fuels to produce cement, steel, plastics, electronics, and clothing contribute substantially to carbon emissions.
Comparison: Industrial CO₂ emissions increased by about 50% between 1990 and 2015; more recent estimates for 2023 show that industrial processes contributed roughly 6.5 gigatonnes of CO₂-equivalent emissions globally.

Transportation
Cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes, which mostly run on fossil fuels, are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
Comparison: In 2023, the transportation sector emitted approximately 8.4 gigatonnes of CO₂-equivalent, with a notable increase of about 7.8% from previous years as activity rebounded post-pandemic.

Food Production
Farming releases carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases. Additionally, deforestation for agriculture worsens the climate impact.
Comparison: In 2023, the agriculture sector was responsible for about 6.5 gigatonnes of CO₂-equivalent emissions, reflecting both direct emissions and those from land-use changes—a significant increase from earlier decades.

2.2 Effects of Climate Change

Rising Temperatures
The Earth's temperature has been increasing at a rate of 0.15 to 0.2°C per decade since 1982.
Comparison: The decade 2014–2024 recorded the highest average temperatures on record, contributing to a nearly 50% increase in wildfire incidents in some regions compared to the 1980s.

Rising Sea Levels
Oceans are absorbing excess heat, causing water to expand at approximately 0.13 inches per year.
Comparison: Since 1982, sea levels have risen gradually; projections for Venice show it is sinking by about 1mm per year, with estimates that the city could be 4 feet underwater by the end of the century if current trends continue.

Extreme Weather
Storms are becoming stronger and more frequent, and droughts are increasing due to altered water availability.
Comparison: Global analyses reveal that extreme weather events have increased markedly since the 1980s, with some regions experiencing a 20–30% rise in severe storm frequency between 2000 and 2023.

Loss of Biodiversity
Species are disappearing at a rate 1,000 times faster than the natural background rate due to habitat destruction and climate shifts.
Comparison: Recent studies indicate that extinction rates have accelerated significantly in the past two decades compared to historical baselines, a trend observed worldwide.

Food Shortages
Climate change affects crop growth and can lead to food scarcity across various regions.
Comparison: Analyses show that in some regions, such as parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, crop yields have declined by up to 20% in recent decades compared to historical averages, increasing food insecurity.

Health Issues
Air pollution, extreme weather, and food shortages contribute to rising rates of diseases, mental health issues, and malnutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations.
Comparison: According to the WHO, heat-related illnesses and respiratory conditions have increased by 10–15% in many regions since the early 2000s, with the most dramatic rises seen during the hottest years (e.g., 2014–2024).
