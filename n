Cause and Effect of Climate change  

Main reasons: 

Cutting down the trees to create multiple forms of paper OR to make wooden furniture OR to generate land to build residential properties or to create farming land. 

Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuel such as Coal, Oil and Natural gas cause large chunk of global emission 

Manufacturing and Industry produce emissions mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like Cement, Iron and Steel, Electronics, plastics, clothes etc. 

Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. That makes transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases (like Carbon dioxide) emission etc. 

Producing food causes emission of Carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, including de-forestation for the search of farming land 

Effect of climate change 

Hotter temperature: according to current scientific data, the earth’s temperature is increasing at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.2 degree Celsius per decade since 1982. The 10 warmest years in the historical record have all occurred in the past decade (2014-2024). Rising Global temperature has resulted in Wildfire, frequencies have increased by up to 50% in some regions, driven by hotter, drier conditions.  

The ocean soaks up most of the heat and becomes warmer and its volume increases (about 0.13 inches per year). Melting Polar Ice, glaciers also cause sea level rise. With the rise of global sea levels, some coastal areas are experiencing floods (e.g. the Venice ground level sinking by 1 ml each year i.e. it would be 4 ft underwater by end of century). 

Destructive storms have become more intense and more frequent in many regions. 

Climate change is changing water availability and leading to an increased risk of drought. 

The world is losing species at a rate 1000 times greater than any other time in recorded history 

Not enough food for everyone 

Climate impacts are already harming health, through air pollution, disease, extreme weather event pressures, mental health and increased poor nutrition in places where people cannot grow or find sufficient food.
