2024 in Review: How Climate Change Challenged Insurance and What the Future Holds

In 2024, climate change has continued to disrupt the insurance industry in unprecedented ways. From the havoc wreaked on coastal properties to record-breaking disruptions in supply chains, every insurance line has felt the strain. This post dives into how different sectors—from Property & Casualty to Personal Lines and Supply Chain insurance—were impacted in 2024, and what future challenges lie ahead.

Property & Casualty Insurance: Battling Unprecedented Losses

2024 Challenges

In 2024, Property & Casualty (P&C) insurers were on the frontline of extreme weather events. Coastal states and wildfire-prone areas suffered major losses:

Hurricanes and Floods: Severe storms along the U.S. coast resulted in roughly $140 billion in insured losses. Florida, in particular, saw repeated hits from hurricanes like Helene and Milton, which forced insurers to reprice flood and wind coverage dramatically.

Wildfires: In states like California, prolonged wildfire seasons led to massive claims, prompting insurers to tighten underwriting guidelines and hike premiums significantly. In some regions, policy renewals were canceled outright as companies reassessed their risk exposure.

Underwriting Overhaul: Traditional risk models, based on historical data, were no longer sufficient. Insurers had to rapidly integrate climate stress tests and real-time data, revealing risk exposures that were up to 30% higher than previously estimated.


Future Predictions

Experts predict that if extreme weather events continue to escalate, P&C insurers could face even steeper premium hikes. Additionally, stricter regulatory requirements for capital reserves may force some insurers to withdraw from high-risk markets entirely, potentially leaving homeowners with fewer choices or more expensive state-backed alternatives.

Personal Lines Insurance: The Price of Protection on an Individual Level

2024 Challenges

For personal lines insurance—including home, auto, and health insurance—the impacts of climate change were felt directly by consumers:

Home Insurance: With rising flood risks and wildfires, many homeowners experienced premium increases of over 50% in areas like Miami and parts of California. Some regions saw policy nonrenewals due to unsustainable risk levels.

Auto Insurance: Extreme weather led to more frequent auto claims. Severe hailstorms and flash floods in certain regions caused auto insurance premiums to jump between 19–22% over the past year, driven by both higher claim frequency and increasing repair costs.

Health Insurance: As temperatures rose and air quality deteriorated, there was a noticeable uptick in claims related to heat-related illnesses and respiratory conditions. This led health insurers to adjust coverage terms and re-evaluate risk models in affected regions.


Future Predictions

Going forward, personal lines insurers will likely face higher underwriting costs as they refine risk models to include climate projections. Consumers may be forced to choose between rising premiums or reduced coverage options. Moreover, the increasing frequency of climate-related health issues might prompt health insurers to adopt innovative pricing models that balance preventive care with risk exposure.

Supply Chain & Commercial Insurance: Protecting Businesses in a Volatile World

2024 Challenges

Commercial insurers covering manufacturing, logistics, and related sectors also faced significant hurdles in 2024:

Disrupted Supply Chains: Severe floods and droughts disrupted global supply chains, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. Insurers had to contend with higher claims from delayed deliveries and production stoppages.

Commercial Property Risks: Businesses in flood-prone or wildfire-prone areas saw their commercial property premiums spike, as insurers reassessed the risk of insuring critical infrastructure.

Operational Interruptions: Companies faced not only direct property damage but also business interruption losses, further complicating claims management and underwriting assessments.


Future Predictions

Looking ahead, commercial insurers will need to invest in more sophisticated risk modeling to capture the interconnected nature of supply chain disruptions. As businesses increasingly demand resilience against climate impacts, insurers that can offer innovative coverage—such as parametric products for rapid payouts—will have a competitive edge. However, higher risks and tighter reinsurance will likely drive costs upward, challenging the affordability of commercial insurance.

Conclusion: Adapting for the Future

The events of 2024 have underscored that climate change is not a future threat—it’s a present reality reshaping the insurance landscape across all lines of business:

Property & Casualty insurers are overhauling their risk models and grappling with unprecedented losses.

Personal lines insurers face rising premiums and evolving coverage challenges, impacting millions of individual policyholders.

Commercial insurers are contending with volatile supply chains and operational disruptions, necessitating innovative solutions.


Looking ahead, the insurance industry will need to continually adapt its underwriting, pricing, and claims processes. Innovations such as parametric insurance and digital claims processing offer promising ways forward, but higher reinsurance costs and tighter market conditions could further drive up premiums. The future of insurance depends on how well companies can integrate advanced climate risk models, embrace new technologies, and collaborate with regulators to ensure that protection remains both robust and affordable.
