When a major disaster strikes, its costs extend far beyond property damage and loss of life. Over the past few decades, the frequency of natural disasters driven by climate change has surged dramatically, while the intervals between events have steadily narrowed (NOAA Climate.gov).

This long-term trend is evident in hurricanes, wildfires, floods, droughts, and heatwaves, which have increased in occurrence by 20–40% since the early 2000s (IPCC SREX Report). Rapid urbanization and a boom in construction further amplify these impacts, as more buildings and infrastructure are exposed to such risks.

As cities expand and development accelerates, the potential for economic and insured losses escalates significantly. In recent years, the data illustrate this trend: in 2024, natural catastrophes resulted in roughly $140 billion in insured losses (compared to $106 billion in 2023), while total economic damage—including uninsured losses—reached around $320 billion.
