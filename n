When a major disaster hits, the cost isn’t confined to property damage and lost lives. Over the past few decades, the frequency of natural disasters driven by climate change has surged dramatically while the gaps between events have steadily narrowed (NOAA Climate.gov).  

This long-term trend is evident in hurricanes, wildfires, floods, droughts, and heatwaves, which have increased in occurrence by 20–40% since the early 2000s (IPCC SREX Report). Rapid urbanization and the boom in construction further amplify these impacts, as more buildings and infrastructure become exposed to such risks.  

As cities expand and development accelerates, the potential for economic and insured losses escalates significantly, looking at past few years, In 2024, natural catastrophes resulted in roughly $140 billion (compared to $106 billion in 2023) in insured losses - while total economic damage, including uninsured losses, reached around $320 billion.
